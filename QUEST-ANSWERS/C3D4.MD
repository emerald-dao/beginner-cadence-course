1. Explain, in your own words, the 2 things resource interfaces can be used for (we went over both in today's content)
> An interface applied to a resource or struct is used to:
> - specify a set of requirements for something to implement
> - allow/restrict access for certain users

2. Define your own contract. Make your own resource interface and a resource that implements the interface. Create 2 functions. In the 1st function, show an example of not restricting the type of the resource and accessing its content. In the 2nd function, show an example of restricting the type of the resource and NOT being able to access its content.

3. How would we fix this code? 

```swift
pub contract Stuff {

    pub struct interface ITest {
      pub var greeting: String
      pub var favouriteFruit: String
    }

    // ERROR:
    // `structure Stuff.Test does not conform 
    // to structure interface Stuff.ITest`
    pub struct Test: ITest {
      pub var greeting: String

      pub fun changeGreeting(newGreeting: String): String {
        self.greeting = newGreeting
        return self.greeting // returns the new greeting
      }

      init() {
        self.greeting = "Hello!"
      }
    }

    pub fun fixThis() {
      let test: Test{ITest} = Test()
      let newGreeting = test.changeGreeting(newGreeting: "Bonjour!") // ERROR HERE: `member of restricted type is not accessible: changeGreeting`
      log(newGreeting)
    }
}
```

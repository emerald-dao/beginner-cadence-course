_1 Define your own contract that stores a dictionary of resources. Add a function to get a reference to one of the resources in the dictionary._

_2 Create a script that reads information from that resource using the reference from the function you defined in part 1._

_3 Explain, in your own words, why references can be useful in Cadence._
> Imagine you want to access a Resource element inside an array/dictionary and do something with it.
> Considering the strict boundaries of a Resource, you'd have to move it out of the array/dictionary, do something, and move it back in. 
> To avoid moving these Resources around all the time, you're better off by using References.

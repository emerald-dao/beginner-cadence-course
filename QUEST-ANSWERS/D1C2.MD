_2 In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?_
> 1. Safety first kids! When you build a smart contract with Cadence, you don't want your baby to be abused and exploited.
> 2. As programming is mainly focussed on solving problems and creating solutions, everything in the process should be crytal clear. A helping community and a good wiki is KEY!
> 3. Cadence code should be easy to read and understand, even for someone with basic programming knowlegde. No steep learning curves!
> 4. Because every developer loves proper commenting, syntax highlighting, error detection and markup rules. This is not only helpful for yourself, but also makes teamwork a lot easier.
> 5. I'll find out in the next chapters!
